# Meimify
  
## Description
Memeify improves upon the preexisting gif search applications(such as giphy) and adds another layer of depth to assist with user simplicity. When searching for a single word, Memeify automatically searches and returns synonyms to help give you the best variety to choose from. Can’t think of the exact word you’re looking for? Through our built in thesaurus function, you can quickly and easily find the gif that perfectly suits your needs as a hip and happening person navigating the cyberspace today.
